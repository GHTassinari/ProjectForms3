# ProjectForms3

A project using the tag forms and stylized with CSS.

This was my third project and the hardest challenged proposed about forms done with HTML and stylized with CSS by the Rocketseat (https://app.rocketseat.com.br) explorer course, where I had, with my knowledge to do a new project from the start, changing things from the last one, as instructed by the Figma project 
(https://www.figma.com/file/fnZyJHs7eqNFAA7tUrKcsD/Stage-03---Formul%C3%A1rio-avan%C3%A7ado/duplicate).
